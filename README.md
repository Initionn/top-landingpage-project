# top-landingpage-project

This is the landing page project! A chance to get really hands-on and in the mud with CSS.

Utilizing an actual stylesheet as well for proper application of styles including text colour, weights, fonts, backround colours, etc.

Commits for this project were much less efficient and correct, barely any atomic commits (if any at all), but a discovery was made; testing/editing minutia in declarations by way of chrome dev tools is much more efficient to see how things look, upon completion of which you can write properly into code and atomically commit. Will be utilized in the future.
